## Introduction

The Wuhan2020 open source community was initiated by a Tongji University Ph.D. student on January 24, 2020. Wuhan2020 is a representative of the larger scale of self-organization that emerged during the COVID-19 epidemic and is also one of the typical technology-oriented self-organizations. 

Within about 3 months of its founding, Wuhan2020 has been volunteering and collaborating on the Internet in an open-source manner. Online volunteers collaborated to build 5 web pages/websites, set up 23 code repositories on GitHub, and included 4,394 items of various information related to the fight against the new crown epidemic through the primary and secondary collection. As of May 20, 2020, these five pages/websites of Wuhan2020 have harvested more than 300,000 clicks, according to incomplete statistics from the self-organized organization. Also, the collection of data and information that it allows to be read and used publicly has led to several cases such as the data connection between the Oxbridge Alumni Aid Society and the local community of Wuhan and the surrounding hospitals and communities, the Gliding Eagle team in Silicon Valley, and the medical supplies assistance of a global medical information service platform in the United States.

The output of Wuhan2020 covers the collection, aggregation, and dissemination of information on hospital needs, logistics, donations, hotels, etc., as well as service function modules such as epidemic navigation. In the middle and late stages of the voluntary collaboration, Wuhan2020 also organized an online Hackathon with the theme of "Digital Open Collaborative Approach to Solving the Social Crisis and Challenges Behind the Epidemic" with multiple resources. The organization of the "Wuhan2020 Open Source Community" and the election of the first board members of the community by an anonymous vote on the 29th of March. In this way, Wuhan2020 has become one of the few self-organized representatives in the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic to date that has declared normalcy and completed the construction of a permanent organizational structure. As a result, Wuhan2020 has become one of the few self-organized representatives that have declared normalization in the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic and have completed the construction of a permanent organizational structure. 

## Member analysis

Statement: All member information data used in the member analysis is not disclosed to the public, and there is no need to worry about personal information disclosure.

As of May 20, 2020, the number of participants determined by the Wuhan2020 open source community through the statistics of participants' email addresses is 4,095. Subsequently, volunteer certificates were issued through the email of volunteers, and a total of 1,942 people received Wuhan2020 volunteer certificates.

    padding: 2px;">All mailbox types in the community, total 4095</div>
</center>

We can roughly estimate the occupation and age ratio of community members through mailbox types and other data. For example, the education mailbox is used by the teachers who participated in Wuhan2020, and the QQ mailbox users are mostly young people born after 1995.

In addition, we found 16 Alibaba email,5 liulishuo email, 4 Jd email, graphite, PWC, etc. We would like to thank the above company members for joining in the activities of Wuhan2020 to fight against the COVID-19 as individuals or companies, and the subsequent support and help to the Wuhan2020 open source community.

In the early stage of Wuhan2020 project, a total of 1,606 pieces of information about the occupation and education of volunteers were collected. According to the collected information of volunteers, these volunteers could be used as samples for member analysis.

The difference between the two figures above is that different dict order is used to divide the careers of members. The dict order in Figure 1 is that of students, engineers, programmers and designers. The dict sequence in Figure 2 is programmer, engineer, student, and designer. The purpose of this design is to distinguish community members with multiple professional identities. Use a class in Figure 1 cut a class in Figure 2 is the number of members of multiple identities.

The academic qualifications of students in the community were subdivided

    color: #999;
    padding: 2px;">The educational background of current students is divided,total 853</div>
</center>

Since the interviewees tend to write students instead of specific education background when filling in the statistics of occupation, Wecan only analyze the interviewees with specific education background other than students, which is only used as a sample and is not necessarily representative.

    color: #999;
    padding: 2px;">educational background of community members，total 1606</div>
</center>

It can be seen from the above figure that most of the community members have bachelor's degree, and it can be inferred that most of the participants in the Wuhan2020 open source community are students aged between 95 and 05, based on the vocational information and email information. A considerable number of gamil email users are from overseas, and the proportion of these members who receive volunteer certificates is relatively small.

Analysis of areas in which community members excel

</center>

From the analysis results of the areas in which community members are good at, community members tend to choose the fields of publicity or design when they choose their own areas, which also explains why there is a serious surplus of publicity group members in Wuhan2020, many of them remain in the community. This also has to do with the fact that most of the data comes from WeChat rather than Slack, where there are more programmers or engineers on GitHub and Slack who are directly involved in the project rather than filling out forms.

## Hack for Wuhan data
We wanted to address the social crisis and challenges behind the COVID-19 epidemic through digital open collaboration. We encouraged user-centric design by hosting the "Hack for Wuhan" hackathon in early March 2020.

This event had over 700,000 online exposures and over 14,500 activity views. We united 43 cooperative communities, 5 technical media, 10 judges, 37 professional mentors, and over 50 event volunteers to contribute to this event.

![Hack for Wuhan data](https://github.com/16647615268/python/blob/master/wuhan2020/Hack%20for%20Wuhan%20data.jpg)

A total of 902 contestants from 33 countries participated the competition, and more than 500 people watched. More than 50 teams entered the competition. 33 teams entered the preliminary contest, 12 teams entered the final contest, and 8 teams won the grand prize in the final contest.

### How data helped

Before launching the hackathon, we sent out a survey to more than 100 people to discover their needs and expectations of the online hackathon. 80% of the respondents had not participated in hackathons before, 45% were hesitant to join, 68% believed that coaching by industry mentors were their biggest motivation, and 34% were students.

Our biggest takeaway was that learning tops competition as a primary motivator for most of the respondents.

Therefore, in addition to having world-renowned venture capitalists and entrepreneurs as judges of the final demo day, we brainstormed and came with an idea to turn the whole week before the 3-day competition into a warm-up week. We would plan "Masterclass" sessions to educate audiences with human-centered design and lean startup methodologies such as MVP (minimum viable product), trial and error, and iterations.

The masterclasses went very successful. We wanted to maximize the desirability of the hackathon, so we also designed a virtual "office hour" mini product for real-time coaching between mentors and teams during the 3-day competition.

Lecturers of masterclasses, together with other 30+ talents, joined the mentor and advisor committee to coach and help participants in the office-hour sessions. These talented people included strategy directors, product managers, engineers, and designers from Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Pinterest, Alibaba, Scale AI, etc.; CTOs and CEOs from Polarr, Vue Glasses, Gliding Eagle, etc.; VCs from GSR Ventures, Sequoia, and Button.

During the 120+ office-hour sessions, they emphasized with people impacted by the COVID-19 and shared personal stories and constructive feedback with participants. Behind the scene, the organizing team kept collecting feedback from participants and mentors and fine-tuned processes on an hourly basis to maximize everyone's engagement. For example, during the first day, some teams registered more sessions than others but missed a few, making others feel unfair. We adjusted the allocation mechanism for the 2nd and 3rd day, balancing between mandatory sessions and on-demand ones. As a result, the engagement rate increased from 84% to 95%.

It turned out that the office-hour mini product received the most recognition, among all the activities and modules of the hackathon. Many participants feedbacked to us that "this hackathon brought us an unprecedented learning and startup experience."

Remember these moments: 3 hackthon master classes, 2 lightning speeches attended by over 19 contestants, and more than 120 one-on-one mentoring sessions between mentors and participants in the contest.

In 20 days, we made it from scratch, from one idea to a global design challenge that made impact.

## 介绍

Wuhan2020 开源社区于2020年1月24日由同济大学一名博士生发起。

Wuhan2020 是 COVID-19 疫情期间出现的较大规模自组织的代表，也是典型的技术型自组织社区之一。

Wuhan2020 成立不到3个月，就以开放源代码的方式在互联网上开展志愿服务和合作。在线志愿者合作建立了5个网页/网站，在 GitHub 上建立了23个代码库，并通过一手及二手收集了4,394项与抗击新冠疫情有关的各种信息。

据自组织机构的不完全统计，截至2020年5月20日，Wuhan2020 的5个页面/网站的点击量超过30万次。其允许公开读取使用的数据信息集合促成了牛津剑桥校友援助会提供的武汉社区及周边地市医院和社区数据对接、硅谷的 Gliding Eagle 团队及美国一家全球医疗信息服务平台的医疗物资援助等案例达成。

Wuhan2020的输出内容包括医院需求、物流、捐赠、酒店等信息的收集、汇总和传播，以及疫情导航等服务功能模块。在开放式协作的中后期，Wuhan2020 还组织了以“数字化开放协同解决疫情背后的社会危机和挑战”为主题的黑客松大赛。“Wuhan2020 开源社区” 于3月29日正式成立，并以匿名投票的方式选出了该社区的第一批理事会成员。

至此，Wuhan2020 已成为抗击新冠肺炎疫情迄今为止少数几个宣布常态化并完成永久性组织结构建设的自组织代表之一。

## 成员分析

声明：成员分析当中使用的所有成员信息数据并未对外披露，无需担心个人信息泄露。

截至2020年5月20日，Wuhan2020 开源社区通过统计参与者的邮箱确定的参与人数为4095人。随后，通过志愿者邮箱发放志愿者证书，共有1942人领取了 Wuhan2020 志愿者证书。

    padding: 2px;">已领取志愿者证书的邮箱种类，总数1942</div>
</center>

可以通过邮箱种类，结合其他数据，粗略估计社区成员的职业以及年龄比例。比如：教育邮箱是参与Wuhan2020的老师所使用的，QQ邮箱使用者多为95后。

另外发现有16个阿里邮箱，5个流利说邮箱，4个京东邮箱，以及石墨，普华永道等，感谢上述公司成员以个人或公司身份加入到Wuhan2020抗击疫情的活动当中，以及后续对Wuhan2020开源社区的支持和帮助。

Wuhan2020 项目初期收集了志愿者的职业以及学历信息共计1606条，根据收集的志愿者信息，可以以这部分志愿者为样本，进行成员分析。

对社区成员的职业进行划分

    color: #999;
    padding: 2px;">社区成员职业分析02</div>
</center>

上面两张图的区别在于，使用了不同的dict顺序，对成员的职业进行划分，图1的 dict 顺序为学生，工程师，程序员，设计师。图2的 dict 顺序为程序员，工程师，学生，设计师。此设计的目的是为了区别有多个职业身份的社区成员。使用图1中某一职业类别-图2中某一职业类别即为多个身份的成员个数。

对社区在读的学生的学历进行细分

<center>
    <img

    <br>
    <div style="color:orange; border-bottom: 1px solid #d9d9d9;
    color: #999;
    padding: 2px;">在读学生学历细分，总数853</div>
</center>

由于在填写职业的时候，更多的人填写是学生，所以只能对填写了除学生之外的具体学历者进行分析，只作为抽样，并不一定具有代表性。

通过社区成员的学历进行细分，包括已经毕业的

    color: #999;
    padding: 2px;">社区成员学历，总数1606</div>
</center>

通过上图可以看到社区成员的学历最多的还是本科学历，可以结合之前的社区成员的职业信息，以及邮箱信息，可以推断出，Wuhan2020 开源社区参与者中，大多数是95-05年龄段的学生为主。使用 gamil 邮箱的有相当一部分来自于海外，这部分成员领取志愿者证书的比例相对较少等。

对社区成员所擅长的领域进行分析

<center>
    <img 
    src="https://github.com/16647615268/python/blob/master/wuhan2020/Field1.png">

    color: #999;
    padding: 2px;">社区成员擅长领域饼状图，总数1606</div>
</center>

从社区成员擅长领域的分析结果来看，社区成员在选择自己所擅长领域时，更多的会选择宣传或者设计类的领域，这也解释了为什么 Wuhan2020 宣传组成员严重过剩，而且能有很多宣传组成员在活动结束后仍然留在社区当中。这当然也跟数据来源大多来自于微信而不是 Slack 有关，在 GitHub 和 Slack 当中的更多的是程序员或工程师，会直接参与到项目当中，而不会填写表单。
